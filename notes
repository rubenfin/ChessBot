Improvements:
Evaluating:
  - Change basic implemenation evaluating
  - Piece square tables
    Rating pieces value based on their position for example: king pawn close to promotion or bishop has more reach on the board
    You can implement it as a 2D array where each piece has a value based on its position

    Ways to implement:
      - Start, middle and end game values
      - Depended on amount of pieces on the board
  - Common patterns
    Gives scores to specfic patterns between pieces like pinning a piece or having a fork or having a strong pawn structure
    Problem:
      Very expensive to calculate and hard to be effective
      Probably usefull to implement in the end of the hackathon when there is computing time left
  - Mobility score
    Gives score to moves if they have a lot of possible moves if changed to that position

  Evalution boilerplate optimazation
    - Change side to move to smaller data value
    - bitboard
